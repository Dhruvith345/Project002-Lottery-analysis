# Project002-Lottery-analysis
This a dataset that contains data of winning numbers with various dates.
 Here I have done analysis on finding the numbers with the highest win rate.
 Which means that these were the numbers which won the most during the lottery.
 Showing the graph on winrate of each number.

 Changes to be done soon:
 I don't know on what multiplier meant so i didn't do anylysis on it
 I hope I find it soon and update changes to the analysis
 My code is not that effient cause I am not familiar with more effient algorithms 
 I would learn them soon and commit the changes on this code
